# datacamp-certificate-projects

## Introduction

This repository contains all 4 projects I did in obtaining the datacamp certificates, including Associate Data Analyst and Data Scientist, as well as Professional Data Analyst and Data Scientist.
For associate certificates, I finished one written report in Datacamp workspace (also available in jupyter notebook format here); for professional certificates, I finished an oral report with Powerpoint after data analysis.
Readers can refer to this repository to gain an insight of Datacamp certificates, but directly using my answer to the same project is prohibitted!

## Ability required
Multiple abilities are tested in the four certificates (projects). 
For theoretical knowledge, please refer to https://app.datacamp.com/certification/resource-center/requirements. 
For practical project, following abilities are tested:

* **Data Validation**: Assess data quality and perform validation tasks.
* **Data Visualization**: Create data visualizations in coding language to demonstrate the characteristics of data and represent relationships between features.
* **Model Fitting**: Implement standard modeling approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning problems.
* **Model Evaluation**: Use suitable methods to assess the performance of a model.
* **Business Focus**: Make recommendations for analytic approaches based on business goals.
* **Business Metrics**: Judge performance of analytic results against relevant business criteria.
* **Communication**: Employs multiple tactics (written and verbal) to communicate to business leaders.

There is one pdf file in each of the project folder where more specific description of these tested abilities can be found.

## Tools used
Mutiple tools are used in the four projects as follows.
**Numpy** for numerical computation
**Pandas** for processing csv files and visualization
**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better and more complicated visualization
**Sklearn** and **Tensorflow** for model building
